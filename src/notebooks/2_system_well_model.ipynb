    "A heavy metal contamination issue has arisen at a site where a smelter, established in 1966 for chromium production, operated without proper anti-seepage measures beneath its slag deposits. Over time, rainfall leached significant quantities of toxic metals, primarily hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) into the soil and groundwater. A commonly used remediation approach for such contamination is the pump-and-treat (PAT) method, which involves extracting polluted groundwater via wells and treating it at a surface facility. However, PAT has notable drawbacks, such as high operational costs, limited effectiveness in low-permeability formations and unsaturated zones, and the risk of altering the natural hydraulic gradient. Field monitoring data showed that Cr(VI) contamination in the unconfined aquifer peak concentrations reaching 1000 mg/L, far exceeding the permissible limit of 0.1 mg/L (He et al., 2024). Addressing this groundwater pollution is critical to protect both environmental health and water quality, since there is an aquifer used for drinking water supply at the area. There are three wells already existing at the area close to the contamination source. They will be used to perform the PAT. "

    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This groundwater flow and contaminant transport model simulates a pump-and-treat (PAT) remediation system for a site contaminated with hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). \n",
    "#### Domain \n",
    "The model domain is a 2D single-layer grid consisting of 101 rows and columns, representing a 100 m × 100 m unconfined aquifer with a thickness of 30 m. \n",
    "### Boundary conditions \n",
    "Boundary conditions include constant head boundaries on the left and right edges of the domain to simulate regional flow, with head values set to 25.0 m and 24.5 m, respectively. Three extraction wells are positioned between the contamination source and a sensitive municipal boundary to control plume migration. Initial contamination is introduced at six grid cells near the source zone using the CNC package, with maximum concentrations up to 1000 mg/L. \n",
    "### Layer properties \n",
    "Groundwater flow is modeled using the NPF, STO, and CHD packages, while solute transport is handled by the GWT model with advection, dispersion, and source-sink mixing processes. The SSM package connects flow and transport components by linking CHD and WEL sources with auxiliary concentration data. Output includes head, flow, and concentration files, enabling visualization and assessment of plume dynamics and remediation performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "An unregulated pump-and-treat (PAT) strategy, where extraction wells operate continuously at maximum capacity, is both inefficient and potentially counterproductive. Without adaptive control, this approach cannot respond to changes in contaminant levels, leading to unnecessary energy use and treatment of clean water. Moreover, excessive pumping risks altering the natural hydraulic gradient, potentially drawing contaminants toward clean areas, including the municipal boundary. In low-permeability zones, it may also reduce effectiveness by bypassing trapped pollutants. Therefore, a controlled, feedback-based strategy is essential to optimize remediation efforts, contain the contamination plume, and maintain water quality standards efficiently."
